<!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE -->

This is the {{tl|used in system}} message box.

It is meant to be put at the top of the documentation for templates that are used in the Wikipedia user interface.

'''Note!''' It is normal that some of the links in the message box are red. 

=== Usage ===

The template can be used as is. But it can also take some parameters: 
* First parameter allows you to change the second half of the heading text. See examples below.
* Second parameter is the name of some other talk page if you want discussion to be made there instead. But a better option might be to redirect the talkpage of your template to that other talkpage.

Here are some examples:

<pre>
{{used in system| in many system messages | Wikipedia talk:High-risk templates }}
</pre>

{{used in system| in many system messages | Wikipedia talk:High-risk templates }}

<pre>
{{used in system| in many system messages }}
</pre>

{{used in system| in many system messages }}

<pre>
{{used in system| | Wikipedia talk:High-risk templates }}
</pre>

{{used in system| | Wikipedia talk:High-risk templates }}

The full code for a /doc page top can look like this:

<pre>
{{documentation subpage}}
{{used in system| in many system messages }}
<!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE -->
</pre>

=== Technical details ===

The [[/sandbox]] and [[/testcases]] links are the standard names for such subpages. If those pages are created then the green /doc box for the template will detect them and link to them in its heading. For instance see the top of this documentation.
