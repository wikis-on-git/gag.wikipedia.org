This is the {{tl|high-use}} message box.

It is meant to be put at the top of the documentation for templates used on 2000 - 100,000 pages.

For templates used on 100,000 pages or more we instead recommend using {{tl|high-risk}} which has a stronger wording.

'''Note!''' It is normal that some of the links in the message box are red. 

=== Usage ===

The template can be used as is. But it can also take some parameters: 
* First parameter is the number of pages. See [[tools:~jarry/templatecount/]] to find out how many pages use your template.
* Second parameter is the name of some other talk page if you want discussion to be made there instead. But a better option might be to redirect the talkpage of your template to that other talkpage.

Here are some examples:

<pre>
{{high-use| 40,000+ | Wikipedia talk:High-risk templates }}
</pre>

{{high-use| 40,000+ | Wikipedia talk:High-risk templates }}

<pre>
{{high-use| 40,000+ }}
</pre>

{{high-use| 40,000+ }}

<pre>
{{high-use| | Wikipedia talk:High-risk templates }}
</pre>

{{high-use| | Wikipedia talk:High-risk templates }}

The full code for a /doc page top can look like this:

<pre>
{{documentation subpage}}
{{high-use| 40,000+ }}
<!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE -->
</pre>

=== Technical details ===

The [[/sandbox]] and [[/testcases]] links are the standard names for such subpages. If those pages are created then the green /doc box for the template will detect them and link to them in its heading. For instance see the top of this documentation.

* {{tl|used in system}} – For templates used in the Wikipedia user interface.
* {{tl|high-risk}} – For the most high-use (high-risk) templates.
* {{tl|high-use}} – For the slightly less high-risk templates.
* {{tl|intricate template}}

=== Template counters ===

* [[tools:~jarry/templatecount/]] – Easy to use, returns current (real time) transclusion count for a template.
* [[Wikipedia:Database reports/Templates with the most transclusions]] – Lists the 1000 most transcluded templates. Updated about once a month.
*  <span class="plainlinks">[{{fullurl:Special:MostLinkedTemplates|limit=500}} Special:MostLinkedTemplates]</span> – Currently disabled for the English Wikipedia, but still runs for other Wikipedias so might be turned on again some day.
* [[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/embeddedincount.py]] – Seems to lack human interface, probably meant for programs to call.
